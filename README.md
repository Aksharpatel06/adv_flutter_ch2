#

* Material : - an open-source design system built and supported by Google designers and developers


* Cupertino : - The Cupertino widgets in Flutter follow the iOS Human Interface Guidelines to implement the visual design of iOS

## Date Picker 

A widget to select dates from a calendar-like interface, typically used for tasks like picking a birthday or scheduling events. In Flutter, you use 'showDatePicker' to display a date picker dialog.

<h6> 

* Date Selection : The date picker allows users to choose a date, typically through a calendar interface where users can navigate through months and years.

* Customizable Date Ranges: You can set minimum and maximum dates to constrain the selectable date range, which is useful for defining valid date boundaries.

* Date Formatting: The date picker automatically formats dates according to the device's locale, ensuring localized date display.

* Dialog-based Interaction: The date picker is presented as a modal dialog, blocking other interactions until the user selects a date or cancels the dialog.

* Callback Handling: The date picker returns the selected date as a DateTime object, which you can then use in your application logic.

* Localization: It automatically supports localization, displaying the date in a way that's familiar to users based on their locale.</h6>

## Time Picker 

A widget to select a specific time, often used for alarms or setting appointment times. Flutter provides 'showTimePicker' to display a time picker dialog.

<h6>
  
* Time Selection: Allows users to select a specific time (hours and minutes), either in 12-hour or 24-hour format.
  
* Customization: You can customize the appearance and behavior of the time picker to some extent, like changing the initial time or setting a time format.

* Localization: Time pickers can be localized to fit different language and region settings.

* Callback Handling: The time picker returns the selected time as a DateTime object, allowing you to process or use it in your application logic.

* Dialog-based Interaction: The time picker is presented as a modal dialog, which means it temporarily takes focus and requires user interaction to close.
