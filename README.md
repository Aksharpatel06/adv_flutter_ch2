* Cupertino widgets offer UI components such as buttons, navigation bars, sliders, switches, and more, all styled according to iOS design principles. Developers can use these widgets to   build cross-platform Flutter applications that closely resemble native iOS apps.

Features

* Adaptive Widgets: The app leverages adaptive widgets to dynamically adjust the UI components based on the selected platform, ensuring a consistent and native user experience.
* Platform Switcher: Users can effortlessly switch between Material Design and Cupertino Design UI platforms using a simple toggle switch.
* Provider Package Integration: State management for the UI platform switching logic is handled efficiently with the Provider package, offering a clean and scalable solution.

* CupertinoTabBar : - This widget represents a tab bar similar to the one you'd find in iOS apps. It typically sits at the bottom of the screen and allows users to switch between different sections or views of the app. Each tab in the bar typically corresponds to a different page or screen within the app.

* CupertinoSlider : - This widget is used to allow users to select a value from a range by sliding a thumb along a horizontal track. It resembles the slider component in iOS. It's commonly used for selecting values like volume, brightness, or any other continuous value within a specified range.

It's similar to a tab bar, but it typically appears horizontally aligned and allows only one option to be selected at a time. Users can swipe left or right to select different options. It's useful for presenting a small set of options where only one can be active at any given time.
