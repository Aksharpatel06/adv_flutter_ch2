## Date Picker 

A widget to select dates from a calendar-like interface, typically used for tasks like picking a birthday or scheduling events. In Flutter, you use 'showDatePicker' to display a date picker dialog.

Features :
<h5> 

* Date Selection : The date picker allows users to choose a date, typically through a calendar interface where users can navigate through months and years.
* Customizable Date Ranges: You can set minimum and maximum dates to constrain the selectable date range, which is useful for defining valid date boundaries.
* Date Formatting: The date picker automatically formats dates according to the device's locale, ensuring localized date display.
* Dialog-based Interaction: The date picker is presented as a modal dialog, blocking other interactions until the user selects a date or cancels the dialog.
* Callback Handling: The date picker returns the selected date as a DateTime object, which you can then use in your application logic.
* Localization: It automatically supports localization, displaying the date in a way that's familiar to users based on their locale.</h5>

A widget to select a specific time, often used for alarms or setting appointment times. Flutter provides 'showTimePicker' to display a time picker dialog.

* Customization: You can customize the appearance and behavior of the time picker to some extent, like changing the initial time or setting a time format.

<h3 align="center">ðŸ”¥ 2.2 Cupertino Widgets (Plarform Conevrter using provider) ðŸ”¥</h3>

#

* In Flutter, Cupertino widgets refer to a set of widgets designed to emulate the look and feel of iOS applications. These widgets follow the design language established by Apple for iOS   apps, providing a consistent and familiar user experience for iOS users.

* Cupertino widgets offer UI components such as buttons, navigation bars, sliders, switches, and more, all styled according to iOS design principles. Developers can use these widgets to   build cross-platform Flutter applications that closely resemble native iOS apps.

Features

* Adaptive Widgets: The app leverages adaptive widgets to dynamically adjust the UI components based on the selected platform, ensuring a consistent and native user experience.
* Platform Switcher: Users can effortlessly switch between Material Design and Cupertino Design UI platforms using a simple toggle switch.
* Provider Package Integration: State management for the UI platform switching logic is handled efficiently with the Provider package, offering a clean and scalable solution.
